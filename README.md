#  Zero-Trust Cloud Security Using AWS GuardDuty & Suricata IDS

A complete Zero-Trust cloud monitoring environment built using **AWS GuardDuty**, **Suricata IDS**, and an **Apache Web Server** on AWS EC2.  
This project detects **port scans**, **credential misuse**, and suspicious network behavior using both cloud-native and host-based intrusion detection.

---

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **multi-layered Zero-Trust detection system** using AWS Free Tier and open-source tools.

It integrates:

- **AWS GuardDuty** – Cloud-native threat detection  
- **Suricata IDS/IPS** – Host-level deep packet inspection  
- **Apache Web Server** – Public-facing workload  
- **Simulated Attacks** – Port scan & root credential misuse  

This setup provides **end-to-end visibility** across API logs, network traffic, and packet-level behavior.

##  Features

### ✔ Cloud-Level Detection (GuardDuty)
Detects:
- Port scans  
- Root credential misuse  
- Anomalous DNS activity  
- Unusual outbound behavior  

### ✔ Host-Level Detection (Suricata)
Monitors:
- Suspicious packets  
- Scan signatures  
- HTTP, DNS, and TLS anomalies  

### ✔ Real Attack Simulation
- Nmap port scanning  
- Apache traffic inspection  
- Credential misuse tests  

### ✔ Reporting & Analysis
- GuardDuty security findings  
- Suricata alerts in `eve.json`  
- Apache logs
